        <h4>About Me: </h4>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Christina (Xinyu) Lin, a student at Brandeis University, where I'm pursuing a double major in
            Computer Science and Economics.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm part of the class of 2025. I hail from the vibrant seaside city of
            Xiamen,located in the beautiful province of Fujian, China. Venturing to
            the United States to pursue my education has been an incredible adventure for me. As an 18-year-old, I'm
            not only the first in my family to study abroad, but it's also my first time experiencing life in the
            States.
            <br>
            <br>
            One
            fun fact about me is that my friends affectionately call me the "cookie monster" because I simply can't
            resist!
            <br>
            One quote that has always inspired me is by Winston Churchill: "Success is not final, failure is
            not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." This quote serves as a guiding principle in my life,
            motivating me to persevere in the face of challenges and to keep pushing forward.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm excited to share my journey, experiences, and insights with you through this website. Join me as I
            navigate
            the world of computer science, economics, and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.

    <h4>(June 2023 - September 2023)</h4>
    During my enriching summer experience at Lavner Education as a TI intern, I had the incredible opportunity to
    inspire young minds through a diverse range of educational topics.
    <br>
    I served as a dedicated instructor, passionately teaching kids the
    art of coding, guiding them through the intricacies of YouTube video editing, and empowering them with crucial
    financial literacy skills. Additionally, I had the privilege of immersing students in the world of tech startups and
    exploring cutting-edge innovations in tech stocks. My role extended to nurturing their mathematical abilities,
    making middle school math an engaging and accessible subject. This transformative experience not only honed my
    teaching skills but also enriched the lives of the eager learners under my guidance, fostering a love for knowledge
    and innovation.
